Sometimes the ElixirLS extension fails to automatically format one or all files.
This extension provides a command to format the current file, and a command to format all files.
It intentionally doesn't try to format on save because the ElixirLS extension normally does that correctly.

## Usage

To run Elixir Manual Formatter:

- Select the **Editor → Elixir Manual Formatter → Format this Elixir file** menu item; or
- Select the **Editor → Elixir Manual Formatter → Format all Elixir files in project** menu item; or
- Open the command palette and type `Elixir Manual Formatter`
